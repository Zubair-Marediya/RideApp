Makes new ride session

Ask to send out texts -> Sends out texts to riders and drivers on SQL DBs using SMSGateway
    -Asks to send out texts (riders) and sends out texts (drivers) and when to compile results
        -Asks riders if they want to go
        -Asks drivers if they can drive and (and next - 2) what time they must leave

When compiling texts:
    -Looks through all texts from when the first text was sent out to the cut-off time for all texts responding with "YES" from riders
    -Looks through all texts from when the first text was sent out to the cut-off time for all texts responding with "YES" from drivers
    -Determine how many cars are needed and place them according to where the people live.
    -Shows results to user
    -***Allows for extra drivers or riders to be added to system*** If this, go back to bullet #3.
    -Asks to send out ride texts using SMSGateway
        -Text says where the ride will meet you, at what time, who the driver is, and who else is in the car.
    -Ends current ride session.

Additional features:
Consider storing all data from each ride session. We can possibly use this data (such as which students come often, where they usually get picked up, how often a driver gives rides) in the future to make the app fully automated. Perhaps we can use machine learning to predict rider & student combos. But this is a very long-term goal, which will require the buildup of data over time.
